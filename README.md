# fsgim-owlTesting
A project to explore the use of SPIN rules for conformance testing of the FSGIM standard (ASHRAE SPC201)

This repository contains one "project" as defined in the development environment of TopBraid Composer (TBC), called fsgim-owlTesting. To set up the system, clone the repository and import the project into the TBC environment. Then execute the SPARQLMotion script buildReferenceSet.sms.ttl. You can use the sample datasets found in the datasets folder, or create your own. The system will generate a reference data set of the defined circuit, and present demand aggregations.

Documentation giving more details is forthcoming.

The work to create this project was kindly supported by NIST Grant 60NANB15D315.
